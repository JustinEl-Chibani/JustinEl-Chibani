👋 Welcome to My GitHub!
Hi, I'm Justin. This is where I share projects I've built—mainly from school and some personal work.

📂 What's Here:
	🎓 Projects developed for coursework and labs
    🧪 Personal experiments and side projects
    🔁 Forked versions of my own work from school organizations (for easier access)
*Everything here reflects what I’ve worked on directly.*

🌐 Portfolio
You can also check out my portfolio (still a work in progress): justinel-chibani.github.io

Thanks for stopping by!
